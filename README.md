## Introduction

This project utilizes Python and popular machine learning libraries to predict house prices. We've used various regression algorithms to build and evaluate models. The goal is to assist homeowners, buyers, and real estate professionals in estimating the value of a house based on its features.

## Dependencies

To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (3.7+)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- (Any additional libraries if specified in the code)

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

For Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
pip install jupyter
```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd house-price-prediction
```

3. Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the Dependencies section.

## Usage

1. Open Jupyter Notebook (if you have it installed):

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

2. Open the `House_Price_Prediction.ipynb` file to run the code and see the results.

3. Follow the instructions in the Jupyter Notebook to load and preprocess the data, train machine learning models, and make predictions.

## Data

The dataset used for this project is located in the `data` directory. It contains information about various houses and their sale prices. The `data` directory also contains a data description file for reference.

## Models

In this project, we have implemented and evaluated multiple machine learning models for house price prediction. You can find these models and their performance metrics in the Jupyter Notebook.
